🚨 Project Showcase: Dynamic Car Sales Dashboard built with Power BI! 🚨
I'm excited to share my latest personal project: a comprehensive Car Sales Report Dashboard that provides key insights into revenue, top products, selling branches, and year-over-year trends. 🚗📊
This project was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to apply the end-to-end data analytics workflow using Microsoft Power BI. From raw data to interactive insights, here’s a breakdown of the process:
🔹 Data Acquisition & Transformation: I started by importing data from Excel, then leveraged the Power Query Editor to clean and shape the data. This involved removing duplicates, ensuring consistent values, changing data types, and removing unwanted columns to guarantee data integrity.
🔹 Data Modeling: To handle data spread across different tables effectively, I implemented a robust data model, creating relationships to enable seamless analysis and accurate reporting.
🔹 Visualization & Analysis: The final dashboard allows users to dynamically filter sales data by car maker, model, country, and year. It visualizes total revenue (19.33bn), units sold (3750), and top performers like the Toyota top selling product and Bristol Motors top branch.
This project reinforced my belief that effective data presentation is just as powerful as data analysis itself.
